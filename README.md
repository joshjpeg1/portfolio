# Portfolio

_**⛔️ Deprecation Notice:** This version of my portfolio is now officially deprecated. It served as my main site from July 2017 to October 2019. You can check out my new portfolio at [joshpensky.com](https://joshpensky.com)._

My name is Josh Pensky. I am a designer and front-end developer, who is very passionate about building gorgeous, functionally-intuitive user experiences.

I have designed and constructed this website to showcase just some of the work that I have done professionally, academically, and personally.
